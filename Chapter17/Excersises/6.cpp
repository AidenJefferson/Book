// 6. This chapter does not say what happens when you run out of memory using new. That’s called memory exhaustion. Find
// out what happens. You have two obvious alternatives : look for documentation, or write a program with an infinite loop
// that allocates but never deallocates. Try both. Approximately how much memory did you manage to allocate before
// failing ?
