// Create a Library class. Include vectors of Books and Patrons. Include a struct called Transaction. Have it include a
// Book, a Patron, and a Date from the chapter. Make a vector of Transactions. Create functions to add books to the
// library, add patrons to the library, and check out books. Whenever a user checks out a book, have the library make sure
// that both the user and the book are in the library. If they arenâ€™t, report an error. Then check to make sure that the user
// owes no fees. If the user does, report an error. If not, create a Transaction, and place it in the vector of Transactions.
// Also write a function that will return a vector that contains the names of all Patrons who owe fees
